# Aircraft Anomaly Detection
Anomalous aircraft trajectory detection using statistical analysis and machine learning.

This repository contains code developed as part of the project Test, Analysis and Simulation taken in the second semester of the second year of the Aerospace Engineering BSc course offered at the Delft University of Technology.

In this project, several methods were used to detect anomalies and the code used for those can be found in their respective subfolders:

- [Runway](runway/)
- [Data Points](data-points/)
- [Convolutional Neural Network](cnn/)
- [DBSCAN](dbscan/) and [Overlap](overlap/)
